# Enturf 
The back-end working of a ticket booking system with admin and employee privileges, including billing, can be implemented using Django and Django REST framework.




    Database Design:
        Define the necessary models to represent entities such as users, tickets, bookings, and billing information. Consider using Django's built-in authentication system for user management.
        Establish relationships between models, such as a one-to-many relationship between users and bookings.
        Include fields in the models to store relevant data, such as ticket details, booking status, pricing information, etc.

    Authentication and Authorization:
        Implement user authentication and authorization using Django's authentication system. This will allow you to distinguish between admin, employee, and regular user roles.
        Assign appropriate permissions to each role to control access to various functionalities and API endpoints.

    API Endpoints:
        Design and create API endpoints using Django REST framework to handle operations such as ticket creation, booking creation, ticket listing, booking listing, etc.
        Configure the endpoints to enforce authentication and authorization for different user roles. For example, certain endpoints may be accessible only to admins or employees.
        Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for tickets, bookings, and billing information.

    Ticket Booking Flow:
        Create API endpoints to handle ticket creation, listing, and updating. These endpoints will be used by admins or employees to manage the available tickets.
        Create API endpoints for users to search for and book tickets. Users should be able to select a ticket, specify the number of seats, and complete the booking process.
        Implement validation checks to ensure that the selected tickets are available and the booking is valid.

    Billing:
        Create API endpoints to handle billing functionality. This may include generating invoices, calculating prices, and processing payment transactions.
        Implement secure payment integration with a payment gateway or service of your choice. Follow the documentation provided by the payment service to handle the billing process securely.
